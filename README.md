Link to all git commands from the terminal.  
Dropdown tap at topright of screen shows different commands(push, pull, commit).

Two Important Rules
  1)  ALWAYS pull before you create a new branch and start working on anything
  2)  NEVER commit or push to main and try not to do it directly to the Sprint branches either.
      Make a new branch off of the Sprint to start working and then merge into the sprint.
      I think I set it up anyways to where it won't let you commit to main.

Tips: 
  - "git pull" won't ever hurt to do, it just won't do anything if there's nothing to pull
  - Use "git switch [Whatver the branch name is]" to switch branches. (Don't use quotes or square
    brackets in the actually command, that was just so you could tell what's what).
